# nairatocefaconverter
This a basic app written in dart, it collects input from a user and converts , that is to say the user enters a naira value and it conerts to cefa, this is juat basic logical app as i used a hardcoded exchange rate that is to say it is constant
We all know it cant be as the exchnage rate is not regularized , it changes per day so i just used 650 as the base rate for the conversion, the user enters in naira and it shown in cefa
